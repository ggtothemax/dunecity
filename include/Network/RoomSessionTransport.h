#ifndef ROOMSESSIONTRANSPORT_H

/**
    A room session, as the game loop sees one.

    There are two implementations. RoomRelayClient carries gameplay through a server; it is the
    legacy transport, kept for older tests and releases. DirectRoomTransport carries gameplay
    peer-to-peer over WebRTC data channels and uses HTTPS only for admission and for introducing
    peers to each other; it is what Play Online uses now.

    The interface exists so that the hardened receive path in NetworkManager - the ownership,
    host and size validation, and GamePayloadRouter behind it - is written once and shared. A new
    transport does not get to bring its own game parser.

    The contract both sides keep: nothing here ever calls into the simulation. update() drains
    whatever the transport has, pollEvent() hands it to the game loop.
