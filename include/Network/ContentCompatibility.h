/**
    Whether two installs are playing the same game.

    Lockstep needs every peer to compute the same thing from the same commands, which means the
    same build and the same content files. On the mesh transport a difference is the expected
    prelude to a mod transfer. On the relay there is no transfer, so a difference is final and
    has to stop the match visibly rather than appear in a log.

    The rule lives here, on its own, because three places need it and they must not drift: the
    shared payload handler when a peer's hashes arrive, the host when it is about to start, and
    the tests. It has no dependencies beyond std::string so any of them can use it.
