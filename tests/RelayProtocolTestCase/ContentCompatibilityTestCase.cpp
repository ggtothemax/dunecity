/*
 *  ContentCompatibilityTestCase.cpp - who is allowed to be in the same match
 *
 *  Lockstep needs every peer to compute the same thing from the same commands, so it needs the
 *  same build and the same content files. On the relay there is no way to transfer content, so a
 *  difference is final: it has to stop the match rather than end up in a log nobody reads.
 *
 *  The rule itself lives in one header because three places apply it - the shared payload handler
 *  when a peer's hashes arrive, the host just before it starts, and these tests - and an answer
 *  that depends on which of them looked first would be worse than no check at all.
