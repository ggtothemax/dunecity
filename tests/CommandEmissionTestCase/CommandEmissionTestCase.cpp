/*
 *  CommandEmissionTestCase.cpp - regression tests for the rate at which the rolling command
 *  history is put on the wire.
 *
 *  The failure these cover is a real one: an HTTPS polling match between a browser host and a
 *  native client ran for 197 seconds and then closed with RoomRelay Close::SlowConsumer, with
 *  nothing wrong in the client's own event queue. CommandManager::update() used to emit the
 *  complete rolling history once per simulation loop iteration, so a peer simulating at 62.5
 *  cycles a second produced 62.5 relay frames a second, while the polling gateway drains at most
 *  64 frames per HTTP round trip. At a round trip near the top of the observed 0.6-1.1 s range
 *  the drain is slower than the production, the relay's per-peer send queue grows without bound
 *  and the 1 MiB slow-consumer guard closes the session mid-match.
 *
 *  So the model here is the production one, not a description of it:
 *    - PollPeerQueue is the queue from tools/room-relay/src/polling.js, with the same 1 MiB
 *      ceiling, the same 4096 frame ceiling and the same 64 frames per response,
 *    - ReceiverModel is the contiguous-run rule from CommandManager::addCommandList(), including
 *      the watermark that stops advancing at the first gap,
 *    - the sender drives the real CommandEmissionSchedule and builds the same window
 *      CommandManager::update() builds.
 *
 *  What the tests then assert is the pair of properties the change has to have: the traffic a
 *  peer produces is bounded by wall time rather than by its frame rate, and no command is ever
 *  lost - not when the simulation catches up in a burst, not when it is blocked in lockstep, and
 *  not when SDL_GetTicks() wraps.
