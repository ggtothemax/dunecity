"""Deterministic generator for the two Habbanya single-player city scenarios.

Both missions are stand-alone Atreides-human maps written into
``data/maps/singleplayer/``:

  2P - 128x128 - Habbanya Crescent.ini   small township + spare MCV, the
                                         Harkonnen city sits at the far pole
  3P - 128x128 - Habbanya Narrows.ini    mobile colony with a depot, two
                                         hostile outposts hold the two passes

Both are *original* terrain, but the geography is deliberately modelled on
Rippsblack's multiplayer map ``2P - 128x128 - 1v1 - Habbanya-Penny.ini``
(data/maps/multiplayer, CC-BY-SA).  The features that map is built from, and
that these two reproduce with their own shapes and seeds, are:

  * a giant oval mountain rim enclosing the whole playable interior, with an
    outer sea of thick spice beyond it and only a handful of carved passes
    through the wall;
  * two C-shaped mountain enclosures inside that oval, each wrapped around an
    interior spice basin and each opening toward the middle of the map;
  * broad winding sand lanes threading between the crescents -- the battle
    routes -- rather than an open bowl;
  * opposed main rock shelves at the north and south poles, with smaller
    second shelves within reach of each of them for expansion;
  * abundant spice and blooms, and worm danger on the exposed sand.

Engine facts these maps are built against (same sources as
``gen_city_scenarios.py``, which supplies every layout helper used here):

  * Zones are 2x2 and every structure sits on rock; roads are a tile flag and
    only stick to rock (CityConstants.h isCityBuildableTerrain).
  * City roles come from CityEffects.h getStructureCityRole: Const Yard,
    Refinery, Silo, Light/Heavy/HighTech Factory, Repair Yard and Starport are
    INDUSTRIAL; Outpost, House IX and Airport are COMMERCIAL; Barracks, WOR
    and Palace are RESIDENTIAL.  Both cities carry all three so a city seeder
    classifies them as DuneCity towns rather than bare Dune bases.
  * Sandworms are owned by ``Fremen`` with no ``[Fremen]`` section, exactly as
    Habbanya-Penny ships them.  INIMapLoader::getHouseID misses the
    housename2house map, falls back to getHouseByName("fremen") and
    getOrCreateHouse builds a neutral house for it (INIMapLoader.cpp:1143 and
    :1069), so no enemy slot is created; House::isAlive (House.h:64) subtracts
    Unit_Sandworm, so a worm-only house never blocks the
    WINLOSEFLAGS_AI_NO_BUILDINGS victory test in House.cpp:947.  Set
    ``INCLUDE_SANDWORMS = False`` below to ship both maps without worms.
  * Objectives are plain conquest, WinFlags=3 / LoseFlags=1.  No quota and
    never WINLOSEFLAGS_ECONOMIC (16), which would win instantly on a prebuilt
    city.

Rock is deliberately left under-built: both cities are compact and irregular,
and every shelf keeps open rock so the player has somewhere to zone.
